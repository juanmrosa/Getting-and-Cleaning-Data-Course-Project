The run_analysis.R script includes all the steps to collect, work with, and clean the course project data set. It finally prepares a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis.

- Download the dataset
First download the data in zip format, then unzipped it to obtain the folder called UCI HAR Dataset.

- Read the data into data frames 
  featureNames <- features.txt (561 rows, 2 columns)
  activityLabels <- activity_labels.txt (6 rows, 2 columns)
  # This files have the variable names required for the data.
  
  subjectTest <- subject_test.txt (2947 rows, 1 column)
  activityTest <- y_test.txt (2947 rows, 1 column)
  featureTest <- X_test.txt (2947 rows, 563 columns)
  # This files contain the test data
  
  subjectTrain <- subject_train.txt (7352 rows, 1 column)
  activityTrain <- y_train.txt (7352 rows, 1 column)
  featureTrain <- X_train.txt (7352 rows, 561 columns)
  # This files contain the train data
  
- Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set

  - Merge data according to subject, activity and feature 
  subjectData <- subjectTest + subjectTrain (10299 rows, 1 column)
  activityData <- activityTest + activityTrain (10299 rows, 1 column)
  featureData <- featureTest + featureTrain (10299 rows, 561 columns)

  - Set names to variables
    subjectData <- "Subject"
    activityData <- "Activity"
    featureData <- featureNames$V2
    # Use the variables on the column 2 of featureNames for the featureData names 

  - Merge all data to create one data set
    allData <- subjectData + activityData + featureData (10299 rows, 563 columns)

- Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
  meanAndStd <- allData (10299 rows, 88 columns)
  # Selecting from the Subject and Activity columns only the rows that contain "mean" and "std" strings

- Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  Use the variables on the column 2 of activityLabels to name the variables on Activity in the meanAndStd set.

- Label the data set with descriptive variable names
  Replace all the "Acc" in column’s name by Accelerometer
  Replace all the "Gyro" in column’s name by Gyroscope
  Replace all the "BodyBody" in column’s name by Body
  Replace all the "Mag" in column’s name by Magnitude
  Replace all the start with character "f" in column’s name by Frequency
  Replace all the start with character "t" in column’s name by Time

- From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
  
  - Create the tidyData (180 rows, 88 columns) by grouping by Subject and Activity first and then summarising      all by the mean of each variable for each activity and each subject.

  - Export tidyData into tidyData.txt file.
